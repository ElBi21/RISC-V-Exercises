# RISC-V-Exercises

Some exercises of ASM for RISC-V processors made during my first year of university

## Repository structure and content of the files

As you may expect, each folder contains the exercises done in each lecture (we did exercises only on certain lessons), plus a couple exercises done for fun / personal projects. I'll mark here below all the files with what it should be the main point of the program (at a certain point I stopped writing them, I wasn't originally planning to publish them).

```
